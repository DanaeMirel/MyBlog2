<h2>What is version control?</h2>
<p>A <strong>version control system</strong> is a tool that manages changes made to the files
and directories in a project. Many version control systems exist; this document
focuses on one called git. Git allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of changes to files,</li>
<li>Notice conflicts between changes made by different people,</li>
<li>Synchronize files between different computers.</li>
</ul>
