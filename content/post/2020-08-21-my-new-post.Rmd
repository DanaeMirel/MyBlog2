## What is version control?

A **version control system** is a tool that manages changes made to the files 
and directories in a project. Many version control systems exist; this document 
focuses on one called git. Git allows you to:

- Keep track of changes to files,
- Notice conflicts between changes made by different people,
- Synchronize files between different computers.
