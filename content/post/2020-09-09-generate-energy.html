<p>You will notice that energy isn’t just physical, mental alertness mattes too. So does positive emotion. Energy is significantly related to productivity. You can increase your energy and overall performance with just a few simple practices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Practice one</em>: <strong>Release tension, set intention</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shift from one activity to the next, consciously setting an intention. This means,
- think about what you want to feel and achieve in the next activity.
- what energy do you want to bring into this new activity?
- how can you do this next activity with excellence ?
- how can you enjoy the process?</p>

<ul>
<li>anticipate positive outcomes from your actions,</li>
<li>think about how do yo want to feel and practice visualizations that generates those feelings,</li>
<li>imagine stressful situations and how your best self might handle them,</li>
<li>seek to insert appreciation, surprise, wonder and challenge into your day,</li>
<li>steer social interactions towards positive emotions and experiences,</li>
<li>reflect regularly on all that you are grateful for.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Practice three</em> : <strong>Optimize heath</strong></li>
</ol>
