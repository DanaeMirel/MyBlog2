<p>Data is being collected around us, and it is coming to us in incredible speed and in very different formats and sources, such as images and voice recordings. Every like, click, credit card swipe, or social media post is a new piece of data that can be use to better describe the present and better predict the future.</p>

<p>We are collecting more data than ever before, and ways to link that data are also in great evolution. For instance think about an online purchase you made in the last month, and the email address you provided for receive the confirmation. This email address can be used to tie your social media and suddenly know your age, your interest, your likes, photos, etc. This additional data can be used to predict what other purchases you’re likely to make. This example illustrates why data is so valuable information for businesses, organizations and governments.</p>
<p>In the age of big data, <em>AI</em>, <em>data science</em>, and <em>machine learning</em> have become buzzwords that are often incorrectly used interchangeably. They are all related in some way but encompass a different range of methods and goals. That’s why I decided to start this series of post, where I will be explaining in general terms the difference between those concepts. See my next post to discover more about AI.</p>
