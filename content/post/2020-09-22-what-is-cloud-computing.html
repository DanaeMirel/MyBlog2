<h3>Outsourcing IT services</h3>
<p>Cloud computing is offered in three different service models each satisfying a unique set of business requirements. It’s important to understand what each model offers. There are three main service models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - offers cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Platform as a Service (PaaS) - offers infrastructure and software for application development</li>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS) - offers ready-to-use applications in the cloud. Over the past years more and more functionality is being abstracted away from the end user, and offered as a cloud service package.</li>
</ul>
