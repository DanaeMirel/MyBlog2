<p>If you think about your audience thoroughly before you build your next presentation, you’ll connect empathetically to them and your content will bring more value to them.</p>
<div id="identify-key-people" class="section level2">
<h2>Identify key people</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Decision makers — people who have the power to approve or reject your idea</p></li>
<li><p>Key stakeholders — those who would be directly affected if your proposal were accepted. Key stakeholders will likely include the person to whom you’re presenting your proposal. But they may also include: your peers, your and other managers’ direct reports, your and other managers’ bosses, your organization’s customers, your organization’s suppliers, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Influencers — individuals who can sway your decision makers and your key stakeholders</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Connect With Any Audience</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Prepare your speech by getting to know your audience ahead of time.</li>
<li>Define how you want to change your audience. What do you want them to do differently as a result of hearing you speak? Throughout your speech, switch back and forth between talking about where they are now and where they could be if they took your advice.</li>
<li>Find some common ground.</li>
<li>Lose the jargon.</li>
<li>Anticipate resistance. That will not only make your presentation stronger, but it will prepare you for the Q&amp;A. And you should always do a Q&amp;A. It will make you seem more sympathetic and give people a chance to be heard.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Listeners’ communication modes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Authoritarian — based on issuing threats and orders</p></li>
<li><p>Visionary — evoking powerful emotions such as compassion, pride, and hope</p></li>
<li><p>Rational — drawing on data to make a point</p></li>
<li><p>Relational — based on familiarizing yourself with others’ culture and language</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="receptivity" class="section level2">
<h2>Receptivity</h2>
<p>People differ in terms of what they know about your proposal or idea, how interested they are in what you have to say, and how strongly they support your views. All of these influence their receptivity to what you’re advocating.</p>
<p>There are six categories of receptivity—each of which can relate to audiences of one as well as audiences of many people:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hostile — they disagree with you</li>
<li>Neutral — they understand your position but still need convincing</li>
<li>Uninterested — they’re informed about your subject but don’t care about it</li>
<li>Uninformed — they lack the information they need to become convinced</li>
<li>Supportive — they already agree with you</li>
<li>Mixed — they have a blend of attitudes and views about your position</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s likely that some of the individuals you want to persuade will fall into different categories of receptivity. In some cases, you’ll have the chance to meet with them separately to argue for your idea. Depending on which categories of receptivity your listeners fall into, you’ll need to adapt your delivery to persuade them. Here are some ideas.</p>
