## 1. Introduction 

Persuading others is an essential communication skill. No one can achieve important goals on their own. Your success relies on your capacity to persuade others to align with your vision. Effective persuaders have the power to capture an audience, convince others to see things from their perspective and convert opponents to their cause. 

Persuasion is a critical skill because you need to use it frequently, in many different situations, and with a variety of individuals. 

## 2. Elements of persuasion
